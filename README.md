# make11-java
Make 11 is a one-player card game played against the computer. The game uses a standard
shuffled deck of playing cards from which the player is dealt a hand of 5 cards. In each round of
the game, the computer deals a card face-up from the deck and the player attempts to add a card
from his hand such that the total rank score of the two cards is 11. In this game, the rank value of
the picture cards (Jack, Queen, and King) is 10 and the value of the Ace is one. If the player is
successful, a point is scored, and the playerâ€™s card is replaced with one dealt from the deck. If a
player can Make 11, they can also opt, in the same turn, to play any picture cards in their hand to
exchange them for replacement cards dealt from the deck. If the player cannot Make 11, they can
play a card of the same suit to allow the game to continue, but no point is scored. The game ends
when a player is forced to play a card that does not Make 11 and is not of the same suit.
